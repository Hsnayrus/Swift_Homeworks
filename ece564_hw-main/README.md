#   ECE564_HW 
This is the project you will use for all of your ECE564 homework assignments. You need to download to your computer, add your code, and then add a repo under your own ID with this name ("ECE564_HW"). It is important that you use the same project name.  
This should work fine for HW1 - HW4.  If you decide to use SwiftUI for your user interface, you can recreate with a new project (keep the name) or follow something like this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56529488/is-there-any-way-to-use-storyboard-and-swiftui-in-same-ios-xcode-project

Any notes, additional functions, comments you want to share with the TA and I before grading please put in this file in the correspondiing section below.  Part of the grading is anything you did above and beyond the requirements, so make sure that is included here in the README.

## HW1
add text here

## HW2
Added a custom UI. A background gradient. Every function works. Also added a clear button

## HW3
Added all required functionality and a new main screen which allows user to manually refresh.

## HW4
Added all functionality and full app icon support. Also added an alert at the start of the app which allows user to choose if they want to load data from local storage or get data from server. Submission time: 2/11/22 9:45 am

## HW5
Added the list view which is accessible by Button named List View. It displays people's information in read only mode. It satistifies points 1
2 and 6 in assignment requirements. I will implement the rest in next week's project along with the extra function.
Also, there is no title named Teaching Assistant in my app because no one has selected their role as a TA on the web server's entries. If you try to update yourself or anyone else's role from whatever to TA, that ccategory will show up.

## HW6
All functionality for HW5 have been added on 02/22/22. 
All features work as they should according to the assignment requirement.
The extra feature added is enhanced search for every possible field. 
Another Extra feature is that pressing the edit button the first time will lead the user into the edit mode and pressing the button again will go back to read only mode. You can notice this by pressing the edit button once, trying to edit the fields, then pressing edit button again and then trying to edit again. Pressing Edit button the second time will make the contentview go back to read-only mode. Also, loading the list view the first time will require a download which will be indicated on the screen. YOu can view the actual list view by pressing back then list view again. 
The extra feature for HW6 is the play and pause music. Refreshing the server takes some time because all the lists are also being updated in the meanwhile.

## HW7
The requirement 1 is satisfied by the text: "Invoker, Dota2". Invoker is my favorite hero's name in the game Dota2. The requirement 2 is satisfied by the gif that follows the text Invoker, Dota2. For requirements 3, 4, 5, I createda gun(because another one of my favorite games is CSGO). You can shoot a by pressing the red trigger. It is loaded with a magazine with infinite number of bullets. 
For the extra points, I added the ability to make the animation go slower/faster. I also added sound to be played when you press the trigger. This sound is also affected by the slider. Note that you are only able to shoot the bullet once the barrel is reset. Another thing I added is that every bullet has a shell which goes to the "ground" whenever the trigger is pressed. Its the black thing behind the bullet. Submission time: 4:39am, 03/09/22, Wednesday.
